# KubeVirt - Building a virtualization API for Kubernetes

## Why KubeVirt?
KubeVirt technology addresses the needs of development teams that have adopted or want to adopt Kubernetes but possess existing Virtual Machine-based workloads
that cannot be easily containerized. More specifically, the technology provides a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy
applications residing in both Application Containers as well as Virtual Machines in a common, shared environment.

Benefits are broad and significant. Teams with a reliance on existing virtual machine-based workloads are empowered to rapidly containerize applications.
With virtualized workloads placed directly in development workflows, teams can decompose them over time while still leveraging remaining virtualized
components as is comfortably desired.

## What can I do with KubeVirt?
* KubeVirt and Kubernetes - Leverage KubeVirt and Kubernetes to manage virtual machines for impractical-to-containerize apps.
* KubeVirt and VMs - Combine existing virtualized workloads with new container workloads on the one platform.
* Containerized Applications - Support development of new microservice applications in containers that interact with existing virtualized applications.
